## Overview
This is a simple web-based restaurant application that allows users to browse menu items, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and make reservations.

## Features

- Add items to the cart and adjust quantities directly on the menu page.
- Dynamic cart page showing total price, quantity adjustments, and item removal.
- Contact page for submitting inquiries via a form.
- Reservation page for selecting date, time, and party size.
